# ðŸ“š React Projects Collection

This repository is a collection of **basic React + Tailwind CSS projects** created by me to practice and understand React.  
The goal is to learn how to build modular components, responsive layouts, and apply modern styling techniques.  

The **Figma designs** for these projects come from the **[Do Some Coding](https://www.youtube.com/c/dosomecoding)** YouTube channel.
